## Why SharePoint still matters in a Modern Workplace

In a world where Microsoft Teams is often the *front door* to daily work, **SharePoint is still the foundation** that keeps content, knowledge, and processes organized.

Think of it this way:

- **Teams** is where conversations and quick collaboration happen.
- **SharePoint** is where information lives, stays governed, and remains discoverable over time.

When you design SharePoint well, you give people a place to **find the right information fast**, reduce duplication, and turn “Where is that file?” into “Here’s the single source of truth.”

## The building blocks: sites, pages, libraries, and lists

SharePoint’s value is in how its building blocks combine:

### Sites: the unit of work
A modern best practice is to treat each major “unit of work” as its **own site** (often a Communication Site for publishing or a Team Site for collaboration). This creates clarity around:

- ownership
- permissions
- lifecycle (start, evolve, archive)

### Pages: storytelling for internal audiences
Pages are your “internal web”—news, policies, project portals, onboarding hubs, and more.

**Tip:** If a page becomes too long, it’s usually a sign the information architecture needs splitting into multiple pages.

### Libraries: document collaboration with guardrails
Document libraries bring:

- versioning
- metadata
- retention and compliance controls
- co-authoring

### Lists: structured data you can automate
Lists are ideal for:

- requests (IT, HR, facilities)
- inventories and registers
- simple workflows and approvals
- lightweight tracking without “yet another Excel file”

---

## Information architecture: design for how people *search*

Most users don’t browse. They **search**, they click what looks relevant, and they move on.

A practical approach:

1. **Start with 5–7 top tasks** your audience must complete.
2. Map each task to a destination:
   - a page (guidance)
   - a library (documents)
   - a list (requests/records)
3. Add metadata only where it reduces friction:
   - document type
   - department
   - confidentiality
   - project

**Rule of thumb:** metadata should answer real questions users ask.

## Hub sites: connect without creating rigid hierarchies

Older SharePoint designs relied on deep subsite structures. Modern SharePoint favors a **flat architecture** connected through **Hub sites**.

A Hub is like the “connective tissue” of your intranet:

- shared navigation
- consistent branding
- aggregated content (news, events, highlights)

**Common Hub patterns**

- Department hubs (HR, IT, Finance)
- Location/region hubs
- Topic hubs (Quality, Safety, Knowledge Base)

**Why hubs work:** they let you reorganize as the business changes—without breaking everything.

## Governance without killing productivity

Governance isn’t bureaucracy. It’s what stops your intranet from becoming a messy file share with a modern UI.

### 1) Ownership and roles
Define who does what:

- **Site Owner**: accountable for permissions and content quality
- **Content Authors**: publish/update pages
- **Site Members**: collaborate and contribute

### 2) Naming conventions
Consistency helps both admins and end users.

Example pattern:

- `DEPT-HR-Policies`
- `PRJ-Delta-Delivery`
- `LOC-EMEA-Operations`

### 3) Permissions strategy
Avoid overly complex permissions on single files.

Prefer:

- site-level permissions
- library-level permissions when needed
- sensitivity labels for data protection

### 4) Lifecycle management
Plan how sites end:

- archive rules
- retention policies
- ownership reassignment

## SharePoint + Teams: make the experience seamless

Users love Teams because it reduces context switching.

You can integrate SharePoint into Teams by:

- adding a SharePoint page as a Teams tab
- surfacing a document library in a channel
- using Viva Connections to bring intranet experiences directly inside Teams

**Practical benefit:** people access official content where they already work.

---

## Automate the boring parts (requests, approvals, reminders)

A good Modern Workplace is not only about storing content—it’s about **reducing manual work**.

A simple workflow pattern:

1. Request created in a SharePoint list
2. Approval routed to the right owner
3. Status updated automatically
4. Notifications sent (Teams or email)

If you already use Power Apps, SharePoint lists are a common starting point for lightweight apps—especially for forms and mobile-friendly experiences.

---

## Adoption: the part that decides success or failure

Even the best intranet fails without adoption.

Here are tactics that consistently work:

- **Start small**: one hub + 2–3 high-value sites.
- **Design with real users**: short interviews and task-based prototypes.
- **Make “What’s in it for me?” obvious**: less searching, fewer emails, fewer duplicates.
- **Measure and iterate**: page analytics, search queries, top content.

**Content hygiene checklist** (monthly):

- remove outdated banners and announcements
- update top links
- archive stale pages
- ensure owners are still valid

---

## A quick “first 30 days” plan (example)

### Week 1 — Discovery
- identify audiences and top tasks
- audit existing content sources

### Week 2 — Structure
- design hub/site map
- define roles + permissions strategy

### Week 3 — Build
- create hub and pilot sites
- migrate only high-value content

### Week 4 — Launch
- publish quick-start guides
- run a short enablement session
- collect feedback and iterate

---

## Conclusion

SharePoint is not “just a document repository.” In a Modern Workplace, it’s the **knowledge and governance layer** that makes collaboration scalable.

When you combine:

- a clear information architecture
- hub-based navigation
- sensible permissions and lifecycle rules
- automation for repetitive tasks

…you create a platform that people actually trust and use.
